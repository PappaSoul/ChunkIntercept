Chunk Intercept

This is a small homebrew game I originally made for the nintendo switch, since its creation is has slowly been ported to various devices and updated.

=== SIDE NOTES ===

+Switch
For the nsp to work you need to update your sig patches! 
For atmosphere you can just copy and paste but if you are using hekate you will need extra patches!

+PS3
For the pkg to work you will need to be on a CFW console. This PKG will not work on developer systems.

+GBA
The screen flashes when playing this game. This is a result of the refresh rate being so slow.
When developing this port I was not able to fix this issue... trust me, I tried.

+GB
I recommend playing this build with a backlit screen. The game advencement works the same as the Thumby port of chunk intercept. If you have touble seeing the chunks press select to invert the screen!
